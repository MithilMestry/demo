        <h2>THE RAMAYAN</h2>
        <p>The Rāmāyana (Sanskrit: रामायणम्, IAST: Rāmāyaṇam) is a Sanskrit epic from ancient India, one of the two important epics of Hinduism, known as the Itihasas, the other being the Mahābhārata. The epic, traditionally ascribed to the Maharishi Valmiki, narrates the life of Rama, a legendary prince of Ayodhya city in the kingdom of Kosala. The epic follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest urged by his father King Dasharatha, on the request of Rama's stepmother Kaikeyi; his travels across forests in the Indian subcontinent with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana, the kidnapping of Sita by Ravana – the king of Lanka, that resulted in war; and Rama's eventual return to Ayodhya to be crowned king amidst jubilation and celebration.
        It was composed in India over a period of nearly a millennium, with scholars' estimates for the earliest stage of the text ranging from the 8th to 4th centuries BCE, and later stages extending up to the 3rd century CE. Ramayana The Ramayana is one of the largest ancient epics in world literature. It consists of nearly 24,000 verses (mostly set in the Shloka/Anustubh meter), divided into seven Khanda (parts) the first and the seventh being later additions. It belongs to the genre of Itihasa, narratives of past events (purāvṛtta), interspersed with teachings on the goals of human life.</p>

        <p>Rama is said to have been born to Kaushalya and Dasharatha in Ayodhya, the capital of the Kingdom of Kosala. His siblings included Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna. He married Sita. Though born in a royal family, Rama's life is described in the Hindu texts as one challenged by unexpected changes such as an exile into impoverished and difficult circumstances, ethical questions and moral dilemmas. Of all his travails, the most notable is the kidnapping of Sita by demon-king Ravana, followed by the determined and epic efforts of Rama and Lakshmana to gain her freedom and destroy the evil Ravana against great odds. The entire life story of Rama, Sita and their companions allegorically discusses duties, rights and social responsibilities of an individual. It illustrates dharma and dharmic living through model characters.

            Rama is especially important to Vaishnavism. He is the central figure of the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana, a text historically popular in the South Asian and Southeast Asian cultures. His ancient legends have attracted bhasya (commentaries) and extensive secondary literature and inspired performance arts. Two such texts, for example, are the Adhyatma Ramayana – a spiritual and theological treatise considered foundational by Ramanandi monasteries, and the Ramcharitmanas – a popular treatise that inspires thousands of Ramlila festival performances during autumn every year in India.</p>

        <h2>The Greatest Energy of Universe</h2>
        <p>Evidence of devotional worship to Hanuman is largely absent in these texts, as well as in most archeological sites. According to Philip Lutgendorf, an American Indologist, the theological significance of Hanuman and devotional dedication to him emerged about 1,000 years after the composition of the Ramayana, in the 2nd millennium CE, after the arrival of Islamic rule in the Indian subcontinent.Lutgendorf also writes that the skills in Hanuman's resume also seem to derive in part from his windy patrimony, reflecting Vayu's role in both body and cosmos. Bhakti movement saints such as Samarth Ramdas have positioned Hanuman as a symbol of nationalism and resistance to persecution.The Vaishnava saint Madhva said that whenever Vishnu incarnates on earth, Vayu accompanies him and aids his work of preserving dharma. In the modern era, Hanuman's iconography and temples have been increasingly common. He is viewed as the ideal combination of "strength, heroic initiative and assertive excellence" and "loving, emotional devotion to his personal god Rama", as Shakti and Bhakti. In later literature, he is sometimes portrayed as the patron god of martial arts such as wrestling and acrobatics, as well as activities such as meditation and diligent scholarship. He symbolises the human excellences of inner self-control, faith, and service to a cause, hidden behind the first impressions of a being who looks like a Vanara. Hanuman is considered to be a bachelor and an exemplary celibate</p>

        <h2>Becaming war Ready</h2>
        <p>The Raja Guru Maharishi Vasishta advised the king to send Rama as Maharishi Vishwamitra demanded. He said that Maharishi Vishwamitra would not have demanded the service of Rama if he was not confident with Rama’s skills. Maharishi Vasishta was already aware of Maharishi Vishwamitra’s power and told the king that it was better not to stand against Maharishi’s Vishwamitra’s demands as the Maharishi can do anything with his power if he gets angry.

            King Dasharatha agreed to send Rama along with Maharishi Vishwamitra and Lakshmana also joins them.
            Maharishis are always treasure houses of knowledge and they gather immense strength through their tapas. So, Indian culture has always respected Maharishis and Sannyasins. Everyone in society has great respect for maharishis and Sannyasins. This can also be seen from Swami Vivekananda’s opening lines of his famous Chicago speech: “I thank you in the name of the most ancient order of monks in the world”.</p>

        <h2>Sita Swayamwar</h2>
        <p>The Syamvara had begun and different kings from different kingdoms were trying their hands on the “Shiva Dhanush” and none of them were successful in lifting it off the ground! It is at this time. Sage Vishwaamithra asks the child Rama to go and “have a look” at the Shiva Dhanush. Normally we would assume the meaning of this phrase “have a look” as to just go and survey the Dhanush and come back. But Rama, being an invincible “Kshathrya” prince, knows the in-depth meaning of this phrase, that is, to “Lift it in his hand and then have a look”! Thus, Rama walks towards the Shiva Dhanush as everybody around him looking with awe! All of them were having a feeling as to how can a little child lift this heavy Dhanush, while even the most powerful among the powerful kings couldn’t lift it!

            Thus, Rama initially has a look at the Shiva Dhanush and surveys it’s length and breadth in his mind for a moment. He bends down and touches it with his small and tender hands. He spots the center of the big Dhanush and holds the center portion tightly with his left hand. Why is he using his left hand here? It is because, only if he lifts the Dhanush in his left hand, he can insert the arrow within the bow (Dhanush) with his right hand</p>

            As per Ramayana, Lord Rama through his wandering years traveled from India to Sri Lanka.[3] During his ‘vanvaas’ or exile, he was not allowed to stay in any village or town and live his life in a forest. Owing to this, after taking his leave from Ayodhya, Lord Rama wandered through the forests of Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.</p>

        <p> In the Hindu epic Ramayana, Maricha, or Mareecha (Sanskrit: मारीच) is a rakshasha, who was killed by Rama, the hero of the epic and an avatar of Lord Vishnu. He is mentioned as an ally of Ravana, the antagonist of the epic. His most notable exploit is his role in the kidnapping of Sita, Rama's wife. His son Kalanemi was killed by Hanuman.
        Cursed to be a rakshasa along with his mother Tataka and brother Subahu, Maricha initially led his life terrorizing sages. He was defeated by Rama at the behest of the sage Vishvamitra. He tried again to kill Rama, but had to run for his life again. Ultimately, Maricha assumed the form of a golden deer and helped Ravana kidnap Sita</p>

        <p>As soon as Lakshman departed and traveled some distance, Ravana, standing by in the woods, changed his appearance and came in the disguise of an old sadhu. And he came to the hermitage gate and he said, “Bhiksham Dehi, Bhavati Bhiksham Dehi.” Sita was stunned, “What sadhu will come to me in the middle of the day, asking bhiksha. It is my dharma as an aryan woman to give alms to any one who asks. She said to him, “Please, you stand there at the gate and I will bring you some food.”

            Sita went inside the house to get some food, and Ravana came to the house and he tried to cross the line. And he couldn’t. Every time he stuck his finger over the line, blazing fire would jump up and sting him. He put his foot there, and the fire burned his foot. And in everyway Ravana tried to cross the Lakshman Rekha, he was unable. And then he understood.
            
            Sita, came to the line, and remembered Lakshman’s word. She said, “Sadhu Baba, please, put your hands next to this line, and I will hand you the food over the line.” And Ravana said, “What do you think I am, I’m a beggar that you will feed me from afar, you won’t bring the food to me and let me sit down and have an asan and a glass of water and a clean place to enjoy my meal! What kind of woman are you? Well, I’ll tell you what kind of sadhu am I. I see that you’re traveling in the forest with your husband and his brother, with two men. I see that your husband has gone off in pursuit of a deer. I see that your husband has been wounded in battle, and that his brother has left the hermitage, and he is going to help. I see that I’m going to give you a curse that your husband will die in this battle, and Ravana took some water. And Sita said, “No, No, No, Stop! Don’t give a curse to my husband, I’ll come and give you the food!”
            
            Ravana put down the water, Sita crossed the line, and Ravana took his actual dress, and his actual comportment and left his disguise as a sadhu. And said, “Sita, you belong with me.” And he picked her up and carried her away.

        <p>Hanuman was part of Angada’s party sent to the south.  For weeks, they searched cave after cave, waded through waterfalls, prowled through dense forests and climbed up, down and all around the mountain slopes of the Vindhya range.  They were in remote areas, many of which were uninhabited.  They saw a forest that had no flowers or fruits or even leaves on its trees.  The barren forest was surrounded by waterless rivers.  No vegetation grew and no animal lived in this wild, desolate place.  There was not even a single blade of grass.  This was the territory of a rishi named Kandu.  He had lost his son at the age of sixteen and, in his anger, he had cursed the forest to become as barren and lifeless as he was.
         Sampati felt compelled to help Rama on his quest.  He was able to tell Angada and the others where Ravana had taken Sita; he explained that they were in Lanka, an island one hundred yojanas away</p>

        <h2>The Demon King</h2>
        <p>Ravana Sanskrit: रावण, Rāvaṇa, was a multi-headed rakshasa (demon) king of the island of Lanka in Hindu mythology and the chief antagonist of the Hindu epic Ramayana and its adaptations. In the Ramayana, Ravana is described as the eldest son of sage Vishrava and rakshasi Kaikesi. He abducted Prince Rama's wife, Sita, and took her to his kingdom of Lanka, where he held her in the Ashoka Vatika. Later, Rama, with the support of vanara King Sugriva and his army of vanaras, launched an invasion against Ravana in Lanka. Ravana was subsequently slain, and Rama rescued his beloved wife Sita.Ravana is widely portrayed as being an evil character, though he also has many qualities that make him a learned scholar. He was well-versed in the six shastras and the four Vedas.[citation needed] Ravana is also considered to be the most revered devotee of Shiva. Images of Ravana are seen associated with Shiva at some temples. He also appears in the Buddhist Mahayana text Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, in Buddhist Ramayanas and Jatakas, as well as in Jain Ramayanas. In some scriptures, he is depicted as one of Vishnu's cursed doorkeepers.</p>

He became conscious about his ability to fly, become as big as the mountain, or as small as an atom. If he willed he could become invisible or carry out such unusual physical feats which were not possible for an ordinary mortal.

        Waking from his deep state of introspection or meditation, the humble, but brave and powerful Hanuman mentally saluted Rama with firm resolve to conquer Lanka and seek release of Sita from her mental and physical sufferings.
            Jai Sri Rama" became the inspiring slogan for everyone to fill themselves with freshness and courage. The dullness and despondency, the anxiety, apprehension, and depression gave way to hope of victory. Hanuman said, "Dear brothers, Sri Rama has infused special powers in my life.

        <h2>The Giant Demon</h2>
        <p>Kumbhakarna (Sanskrit: कुम्भकर्ण, lit. pot-eared) is a powerful rakshasa and younger brother of Ravana from the Hindu epic Ramayana. Despite his gigantic size and appetite, he is described as a virtuous character and a great warrior in Hindu texts. He is said to have slaughtered 8,000 vanaras over the course of Rama's mission to rescue Sita.
             Vibhishana narrated that Kumbhakarna had been born with immense strength, having subdued both Indra and Yama, striking the former in the chest with the broken tusk of Airavata. At the bequest of Indra, Brahma cursed the rakshasa to "sleep like he is dead". On Ravana's request, he commuted the curse to have the rakshasa sleep for six months at a time, and wake up for exactly one day to wreak havoc and devour to his heart's content.
            
            In a popular retelling of this tale, Kumbhakarna, accompanied by his brothers Ravana and Vibhishana, performed a major yajna to please Brahma. Indra was worried and jealous of his strength so he went to Brahma before Kumbhakarna's boon could come to fruition.
            
            When Kumbhakarna asked for his boon, his tongue was tied by the goddess Saraswati, who acted on Indra's request. Instead of asking for Indraasana (the throne of Indra), he asked for Nidraasana (bed for sleeping). It is also said that he intended to ask for Nirdevatvam (annihilation of the devas) and instead asked for Nidravatvam (sleep). His request was instantly granted. However, his brother Ravana requested Brahma to undo this curse as a boon and Brahma reduced it to sleeping for six months, after which he would sleep again as soon as his appetite was satisfied.</p>

            This is the final battle between Rama and Ravana. Rama has pursued Ravana in his chariot and fires golden arrows, which turn into serpents as they reach Ravana. The arrows cut off Ravana's many heads but they immediately grew back again. This goes on for days and nights, and Ravana shoots hundreds of arrows as the two fight to the death.
            
            Matali, Rama's charioteer watches the struggle and suggests that "To kill Ravana you must use the dreaded arrow of Brahma, given to you by Agastya, which never misses its target". So Rama shot the divine arrow, which had the power of the gods in it, which pierced Ravana in the heart and killed him</p>
